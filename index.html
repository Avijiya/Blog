  			<p class="text-muted " >Nahargarh Fort, situated on the outskirts of Jaipur, is known for breathtaking views of the city and for its extended wall that connects it to Jaigarh Fort. Embellished with delicate carvings and stonework, the Nahargarh Fort is an impregnable structure and together with its two neighbouring forts - Amer and Jaigarh once stood as the strong defence of Jaipur city.</p>

    <p>I went to watch the movie and I loved it. The story shows how a young lion prince, after the murder of his father, flees his kingdom only to learn the true meaning of responsibility and bravery. This movie is worth a watch for its gorgeous visuals and cinematography. The music was phenomenal. Beyonc√© really brought Nala to live but the show stealers were Timon and Pumba.</p>

    <p>The One and Only Ivan is a true story which highlights the feelings of caged animals. It shows what animals go through when they are deprived of their rights to be free. People for their selfish reasons and entertainment put these animals in malls, circuses,etc. We need to stop this kind of animal cruelty.</p>

    <p>"The Shadows" is one of my favourite book from the series of "The Books of Elsewhere". It is about a family who shifted into an old house where the spirit of the previous owner wanted to get rid of them but their daughter somehow managed to handle the situation with the help of the boy from the painting and the three talking cats.</p>
